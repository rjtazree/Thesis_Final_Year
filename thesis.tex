\section*{Abstract}
\justify
Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are a radio-based network technology that has gained considerable importance in network research community. It is a multi-hop wireless access network where nodes can act both as a host as well as a router. One of the factors that influence the performance of WMNs is the underlying routing protocol used. Since implementation of wireless routing protocols in a real test bed is difficult, hence, simulation environment is being considered for performance evaluation of a routing protocol in a wireless scenario. Recently, a new network simulator called NS-3, which is in its developing stage, demands a great potential (as claimed by the developers group) for performance analysis of different routing protocols. In this project we aim to implement and analyze the performance of DSR, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) and Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in Network Simulator 3 (ns-3).
\end{center}

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation of the Work}
Wireless mesh network has gained muchpopularity now a days for itâ€™s instant connection.It has mesh router which connects with mesh clients immediately.Special mesh protocols are employed to work among mesh routers ,mesh clients and between mesh router and client.The routing protocols are used to discover multi hop connection between nodes.\\
About 70+ protocols have been roposed for mesh network.But very few supports ns-3 software.So performance analysis of these protocols are important to be implemented.


\section{Contribution of the Work}
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of wireless mesh networks
using AODV, DSR and OLSR protocols in terms of different parameters. 


\section{Organization of the Project}
The remainder of the report is organized as follows. In the next chapter, an overview of our project related terminologies are explained and contains  discusssion on previous works that is already implemented with  limitations. Chapter 3 describes the working procedure of our  system. In Chapter 4, we have illustrated our implementation of the project in details. Chapter 5 focuses on the experimental result of the proposed system. The thesis concludes with a summary of research contributions and future plan of our work in chapter 6. This thesis contains an appendix intended for persons who wish to explore the source code.



\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Wireless Mesh Network}
Various wirelesss networks make the communication easy.Wireless mesh network is  such a network that makes communication easy with out medium.In WMN,there are mesh routers and meah clients.They can communicate with each other.Each node can operate as host and as also as client.Wmn is dynamicallly self organized and self constructing.Conventional nodes.e.g pc,tablet,phone etc. can be internally connected if they are connected with wireless network interface card(NIC).Customers with wireless NIC can connect to network by connecting with wireless routers for exaample,Ethernet.Thus wmn can be helpful to anyone anytime.Moreover the gateway functionlaities in mesh routers enable the integration of WMN with various wireless network such as cellular system,WiFi and Wimax dervice.



\subsection{Network Architecture}
WMN consist of two types of nodes: mesh routers and mesh clients.The routing
capability for gateway/repeater functions as in a conventional wireless router, a wireless mesh
router contains additional routing functions to support mesh networking. To improve
the flexibility of mesh networking, a mesh router is usually equipped with multiple wireless
interfaces built on either the same or different wireless access technologies.

Mesh clients have the necessary functions for mesh networking, and thus can also
work as a router in WMN. However, gateway or bridge functions don't exist in these nodes.
Besides, mesh clients usually have only one wireless interface. So, the
hardware platform and the software for mesh clients can be much simpler than those for mesh
routers. Mesh clients have a variety of devices compared to mesh routers. They can be
a laptop/desktop PC, pocket PC, PDA, BACnet (Building Automation
and Control network) controller, and many other devices.

The architecture of WMNs can be classified into three main groups based on the
functionality of  nodes.


\subsubsection{Infrastructure/Backbone WMNs}
Infrastructure of wmn includes mesh router that forms infrastructre for mesh clients.The infrastructre can be built using various technologies in addition to heavily used IEEE 802.11 technology.Mesh routers form a self configuring ,self healing network.With gateway functionality,routers can be connected to internet.This is also reffered as infrastructure meshing,provides backbone for conventional clients.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{infrastructure-mesh-clear.png}
\caption{Infrastructure/Backbone WMN}
\end{figure}

Infrastructure/Backbone WMNs are the most commonly used type. For example,
community and neighborhood networks can be built using infrastructure meshing.
The mesh routers are placed on the roofs of houses in a neighborhood, and these
can serve as access points for users in homes and along the roads. Typically, two
types of radio are used in the routers, i.e., for backbone communication and for user
communication. The mesh backbone communication can be established using long-
range communication techniques including, for example, directional antennas.

\subsubsection{Client WMNs}
Client meshing provides peer to peer meshing among client device.In this network,client node constitute the actual network to perform routing and configuration functionalities as well as providing end user application to customer.So,a nesh router is not required for this type of network.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{client-wmn.png}
\caption{Client WMNs}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Hybrid WMNs}
This architecture is combination of infrastracture and client meshing.Mesh clients can access the network by directly the mesh routers or connecting to the mesh clients.While the infrastructure orovide netwrok to other such as internet,Wifi,Wimax,cellular,the routing capabilities of clients provide improved connectivity and coverage inside the WMN.

%\subsection{Management}
%\subsection{Operation}

\subsection{Application}
Research and development of WMN is motivated by several applications which clearly demonstrate the market but at the sam time these appplications can not be supported directly by other wireless networks such as cellular system,ad hoc networks.wireless sensor networks,IEEE 802.11 etc.In this section we discuss about these applications,

\begin{itemize}
\item Broadband home networking
\item Community and neighborhood networking
\item Enterprise networking
\item Metropolitan area networks (MAN)
\item Transportation systems
\item Building automation
\item Health and medical systems
\item Security surveillance systems
\end{itemize}
In addition to these applications,WMN can also be applied to spontaneous network and p2p networking.For example, wireless network for an emergency team and firefighters do not have prior knowedge of where the network should be deployed.By placing wireless mesh routers in a desired place,a WMN can quickly be formed.For a group of people holding wireless capable devices,e.g,laptop ,PDA,cellphone,P2P communication is anytime is an easy solution.WMN is able to meet the demand.These network illustrate that mesh network is a superset of adhoc network and thus can accomplish all functions provided by ad hoc network.



\section{Routing Protocols}
Routing protocols can  be proactive or reactive.In proactive routing ,connection between nodes form before any traffic flow among nodes.Reactive routing forms only after data flows among nodes.A routing protocol can be static or dynamic depending on  whether or not the network experiences variation in link quality, topology,traffic load etc.Two popular dynamic schemes are distance vector routing and link state routing which were proposed for wired networks have become the cornerstone of many  dynamic routing protocol of manet and WMN.


\subsection{Reactive Protocols}
Reactive protocols are based on routes on demand.If a node wants to start communicate with a node that has no route with it,the protocol will try to form such a routh path to communicate.Reactive protocol searches the route in an on demand manner and set the link to send packet from source tod estination node.Routing discovery is used it in here by flooding the route request (RREQ) packets throughout the network.Examples of reactive routing protocols are dynamic source routing(DSR) and ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV).



\subsection{Proactive Protocols}
Proactive protocols are table driven.These protocols assume that it is efficient to search route regularly.As soon as a node tries to send data packets,the assumption is that the route is allready discovered.They maintain destination list and keep up to dating it.The routing table always remains consistent for regular up to date.Due to having existing route available,transmission will occur with no delay when any packet arrives.These type of protocol can be more efficient with repect to time needed to deliver packets.Some example are   the Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking (B.A.T.M.A.N.) protocol, the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and Destination-Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) protocol.


\subsection{Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) }
The Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) is a mesh
routing protocol inspired by AODV protocol and tree-routing. It is
believed that  combination of reactive and
proactive elements of HWMP enables efficient path selection
in a wide variety of mesh networks. HWMP uses a common
set of protocol primitives, generation and processing rules
adapted from Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector Protocol for MAC addressing and link metric . HWMP
supports two modes of operation depending of configuration.
These modes are not exclusive and can be used
concurrently.

In the on-demand mode the path discovery starts when 
source mesh station has a data to transmit to unknown
destination station. It broadcasts a Path Request PREQ man-
agement frame for that destination. Each station, receiving
PREQ creates a route to a source, updates metric and for-
wards it. If the station has a valid routing information to a
destination or station is the destination itself, it gener-
ates a Path Reply PREP management frame.

In the proactive mode of operation, a single mesh station is
configured to be  path tree root and it broadcasts PREQs
periodically. Each station receiving a proactive PREQ up-
dates it path to root and answers to it by PREP always or
when it has data to send .
Due to this, every station knows route to tree root and root
knows a route to each mesh station. If direct route to destination is unknown, data will be forwarded to root which
is responsible to forward it to  final destination.

\subsection{Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol (AODV)}
Adhoc on demand routing protocol is a protocol for manet wireless network.It uses an on demand approach for finding routes.Route is established only when data is transmitted by a source node.It employs destination sequence number to identify the most recent paths.In AODV,the source node and the intermidiate node store the informatiion of next hop corresponding to data flow for packet transmission.In on demand routing protocol,The source node floods the route request in the network when a route is not available for a desired destination.From a single Route Request,it may obtain multiple route to  destination node.The major difference between AODV and other on demand routing protocol is that it keeps a destination sequence number to determine an up to date path to destination.A node updates itâ€™s path information only if the DestSeqReceived of the current packet received is greater or equal than the  last DestSeqNum stored at the node with smaller hopcount.



\subsection{Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)}
Optimized link state routing (OLSR) is a proactive routing protocol for MANETs and WMNs.
This protocol has the benefit of having the routes available when needed because
of it's proactive nature. The underlying mechanism of the protocol is the periodic
exchange of messages to find routes. Since OLSR reduces the control packets size
and minimizes flooding of this control traffic, it is known as optimization of a pure
link state protocol.  Every node stores the routes to all destinations
in the network.So, it is applicable where a large subset of nodes
are communicating with each other or nodes are changing with time. The protocol is
specifically appropriate for large and dense networks .
OLSR works in a distributed manner without depending on any central
entity. A reliable transmission is not needed for its control messages, as sending
these messages occurs periodically




\subsubsection{HELLO Message}
OLSR makes use of "Hello" messages to find its one hop neighbors and its two hop neighbors through their responses. The sender can then select its multipoint relays (MPR) based on the one hop node that offers the best routes to the two hop nodes. Each node has also an MPR selector set, which enumerates nodes that have selected it as an MPR node. A HELLO message contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item the list of addresses of the neighbors to which there exists a valid bi-directional link
\item the list of addresses of the neighbors which are heard by this node (a HELLO has been received) but the link is not yet validated as bi-directional link. If a node find its own address in a HELLO message, it considers the link to the sender node as bi-directional.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{mpr.png}
\caption{Flooding a packet in a wireless multi-hop network from the center node using MPRs(black)}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Topology Control (TC) Message}
OLSR uses topology control (TC) messages along with MPR forwarding to disseminate neighbor information throughout the network. TC messages are forwarded like usual broadcast messages in the entire network. A TC message is sent periodically by each node in the network to declare its MPR Selector set, i.e., the message contains the list of neighbors who have selected the sender node as a multipoint relay. The sequence number associated to this MPR Selector set is also attached to the list.The information diffused in the network by these TC messages will help each node to build its topology table. A node which has an empty MPR Selector set, i.e., nobody has selected it as a multipoint relay, may not generate any TC message.

\subsubsection{Core Functionality}
Nodes in the network start broadcasting by HELLO message to their neighbours to detet one hope and two hope neighbours.Then nodes will try to send their TC message to the entire network.These message allow nodes to update their routing table for different  other nodes in the network.To construct routing table of a node,a shortest path algorithm is used.It meanâ€™s  that this routing protocol applies Dijkstra algorithm.

After broadcasting HELLO and TC messages regularly and if the network does
not change, all nodes have the topological information of  entire network, like distance from different nodes, one-hop neighbors of every node, next node to the
destination, etc.
\subsection{Dynamic Source Routing(DSR)}
DSR is a routing protocol of mesh network.It is similar to AODV.It uses source routing instead of routing table at each intermediate device.
Here, each source determines the route to be used in transmitting its packets to selected destinations. There are two main components, called Route Discovery and Route Maintenance. Route Discovery determines  optimum path for a transmission between  given source and destination. Route Maintenance ensures that the transmission path remains optimum and loop free as network conditions change, even if this requires changing route during  transmission.

\section{Related Works}
Simulation is one of the important tool for assessing the
performance of routing protocols in a Wireless scenario. Till
date, the performance evaluation of most ad hoc routing
protocols has been carried out in a simulation test bed using
NS-2. Recently, a new network simulator called NS-3 which is in its developing stage, demands a great
potential (as claimed by the developers group) for performance analysis of different routing protocols [5].
The performance analysis of AODV in WMNs has been done using ns-3 [6]. OLSR protocol is also a comparatively newer protocol for mobile ad hoc networks [7]. Performance of OLSR protocol is analyzed in [8] and [9]. An improved OLSR protocol which is simulated under ns-3 is also proposed in [10].

\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Findings of the Work}
In this research we focused on the performance of DSR, AODV and OLSR protocols. The
implementation of the simulation has been done in NS-3 and with the results we have evaluated
the performance of  DSR, AODV and OLSR protocol. In most of the cases we have seen that the
performance of DSR is slightly better than OLSR and AODV. 
\section{Future Improvements}

We will use DSR protocol on more complex and complicated scenario. We are also planning
to implement our project with more different parameters. In future we will compare DSR with
some other better protocols. DSR could be an important field to research which would help to
improve its performance on a specified wireless mesh network.
